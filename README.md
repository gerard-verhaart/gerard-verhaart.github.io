Gerards Github Blog

**About Me**
I am Gerard, using this course to get from a IT Support role into a Development role at my company.

**Progress**
I'm happy with the progress so far, and it looks like this course is the right one for really getting into programming with a kick-start.

**Style Choices**
I chose to do a simple Blog website with a centered Banner at the top and the content below it, with navigation links going back and forward and a Table with all the blogs on the front page.

**Table of Contents** - generated using Markdown All-In-One by Yu Zhang
- [gerard-verhaart.github.io](#gerard-verhaartgithubio)

**Code Snippets**
At the start I was mixed up and using ID's as Class. After I learned my mistake and how to separate them it was a matter of fixing up my code and checking to make sure the Classes were applying correctly.

I also had a big issue where the H1 title and H3 date on the blogs were meant to be on the top corners of the blog, but the date would always take the line below. I fixed this using an _invisible table_ (no borders) set to width 100% and with H3 being right-aligned.

**The Future**
The future website will probably have a lot of Javascript in it and will edit the content of the pages. As such, I tried to make my website as simple and navigible as possible with much of the code pushed to the CSS file as possible in order to make it easy to see and update the elements on each page using Javascript in the future.
