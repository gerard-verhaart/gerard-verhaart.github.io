      <h2>Week 1</h2>
      <p>
        This week was the first week of Bootcamp - there were a lot of lectures and a lot of content, and I wasn't expecting to go so far past what we had covered in Foundations so quickly!
        There was also a lot of meeting new people, trying to learn their names, and getting to know the schedule, learning space, and facilitators.
        I found that I was learning something new every day, so this course seems to really hit the sweet spot for me in terms of optimal learning.
        This was also my first real introduction to pair programming with someone new each day, and how to work the Driver/Navigator roles.
      </p>
      <h2>Week 2</h2>
      <p>
        This week we moved more into the actual layout of how we will be working going forward.
        Group projects started at the end of the week, and I got a real sense for how our weeks would be planned out during a "regular" week.
        Group projects was one of the more challenging things due to the fact that you can't pair program when you have 4 people in a team.
        Also, our commits kept clashing so this was a new learning experience, how to resolve code conflicts.
        For our group I had the role of "Vibe Manager" in charge of taking the teams temperature and making sure we were taking breaks and working together well.
        I also had some fun with creating a new Json data object and manipulating it in the website.
      </p>
      <h2>Week 3</h2>
      <p>
        This week is the end of Phase 3 - we're all settling into the coding routine now, and I feel like I know everybody's names and general personality now.
        I've pair coded with more than half of my cohort, and I'm starting to really see the differences between how people code and how they cope with feedback and challenges.
        We also talked about personal projects and we'll have a phase wrap party on Friday, so I'm really looking forward to that!
        Human Skills are ticking along nicely, I got some actionable constructive feedback that I can work through and so I'm seeing results in both soft and hard skills from this course.
