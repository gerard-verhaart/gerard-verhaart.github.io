      <h2>Week 1</h2>
      <p>
        This week was the first week of Bootcamp - there were a lot of lectures and a lot of content, and I wasn't expecting to go so far past what we had covered in Foundations so quickly!
        There was also a lot of meeting new people, trying to learn their names, and getting to know the schedule, learning space, and facilitators.
        I found that I was learning something new every day, so this course seems to really hit the sweet spot for me in terms of optimal learning.
        This was also my first real introduction to pair programming with someone new each day, and how to work the Driver/Navigator roles.
        New Technologies: Javascript, Github, Git, Pair Programming, Node.js, First Class Functions, Types, TDD, JSON, File Encoding.
      </p>
      <h2>Week 2</h2>
      <p>
        This week we moved more into the actual layout of how we will be working going forward.
        Group projects started at the end of the week, and I got a real sense for how our weeks would be planned out during a "regular" week.
        Group projects was one of the more challenging things due to the fact that you can't pair program when you have 4 people in a team.
        Also, our commits kept clashing so this was a new learning experience, how to resolve code conflicts.
        For our group I had the role of "Vibe Manager" in charge of taking the teams temperature and making sure we were taking breaks and working together well.
        I also had some fun with creating a new Json data object and manipulating it in the website.
        New Technologies: Express Server, Queries, Routing, Destructuring, Paths, Handlebars, Package Dependencies, Testing, Accessibility (Wave), Deployment, Promises.
      </p>
      <h2>Week 3</h2>
      <p>
        This week is the end of Phase 1 - we're all settling into the coding routine now, and I feel like I know everybody's names and general personality now.
        I'd pair coded with more than half of my cohort, and have started to really see the differences between how people code and how they cope with feedback and challenges.
        We also talked about personal projects and we also had a phase wrap party on Friday which was a good time to socialise with my classmates!
        Human Skills are ticking along nicely, I got some actionable constructive feedback that I can work through and so I'm seeing results in both soft and hard skills from this course.
        New Technologies: Databases, NPM Modules, Migrations, Seeds, Postgres, Hash, Knex, Scripts, Async / Await.
      </p>
      <h2>Week 4-6 (Phase 2)</h2>
      <p>
        This part was all about learning lots of new stuff, with an ephasis on front end (client-side) rendering - the mornings would generally be for introducing a new technology, and then the afternoons would be a pair-programming lab session for putting it into practice.
        I found it pretty fun and challenging, and there was always something new every day to wrap your head around. I really got to know my classmates and work with them all, and we also had Friday projects to really solidify the weeks teachings.
        New Technologies: React, Typescript, Components, Bundles, Forms, React Router, Restful APIs, Insomnia Tool, Interfaces, Superagent (for testing), SQL Queries, Hooks, External/Internal API's (including Keys and CORS), Ternery Operators, Nock, Jest, States, Redux Store, Thunks, Actions, Reducers, SCSS
      </p>
      <h2>Week 7-9 (Phase 3)</h2>
      <p>
        These weeks were all about projects - we had a final lecture on Auth0 (setting up Authentication) and some optional lectures on new technologies not assessed in the course (like sockets, methodologies, etc).
        There were some assessments that were started earlier that we needed to get finished, and we had 2 mini-projects leading into a final week-long project to really put our skills to use.
        It was definitely less structured, but still really busy and a good time to really explore anything I felt less confident in.
        New Technologies: Auth0, OOP, Class vs Components, AWS, Email APIs, Teamwork.
