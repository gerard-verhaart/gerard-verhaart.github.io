        <h2>Conways</h2>
        <p>
          This started pretty early on during the Dev Academy Bootcamp - one of the optional extra exercises was doing "Conways - The Game of Life" which is a mathematical model made of a grid of squares that live or die according to the state of the squares around them.
          This was done in Javascript and the exercise itself was done using Test Driven Development - tests were already built for it and there was no support offered by the teaching staff, so this was 100% something I had to figure out in my own time. This was a CLI program written entirely in Javascript.
          Towards the end, I thought about how I could adapt it given the technologies taught at Dev Academy - I decided to rework it with a full separate API for board seeds and random seeds hosted at Dev Academy, and a front-end using Typescript, HTML, and SCSS to display and run the games.

        <h2>My Manga Collection</h2>
        <p>
          This project was done towards the end of the Dev Academy course - I decided to do a small website to keep track of my Manga collection, and where everything is stored (as it can get hard to track!).
          It's a very small website, but beneath the hood it uses a lot of new technologies - Typescript, React, Redux, API's, and a fully functional Database.
          I can see plenty of potential for a rework of it in future as I learn new things as well.

        <h2>Devveron 2.0 Game</h2>
        <p>
          This was our final Group Project for the Dev Academy Course - this is the culmination of 4 people's work over a week, and we're very proud of the result.
          It's a click adventure game where you navigate around a world and do quests and things - there's a lot of in-jokes for Dev Academy Alumni in here as well.
          We experimented with some different technologies here - Auth0 for login, Sockets for chat and API, etc.
          To log in, just create an account with a fake email (it doesn't send a verification email) and for convenience use "Password1!" to fulfil minimum requirements.

        <h2>Planned Future Projects</h2>
        <p>
          I'm always brimming with ideas! The next thing I was thinking was creating a "Cards for Humanity" game (a family friendly version of Cards Against Humanity) as I want to play with click-and-dragging cards onscreen and playing more with CSS - stretch goals for this will be saving good card combos, etc.
