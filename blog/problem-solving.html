        <h2>My Time stuck on a Simple Problem~</h2>
        <p>
          Once upon a time I was stuck on a simple problem. I had code that ran through a group of items to try and find if Scooby was hiding in the object.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, Scooby was never being found. I decided to just run the bit of code that had scooby in it, and made sure for each loop of code it printed all of the values of the hidden property to the console screen.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sure enough, it turned out the loop was not running. All of the other calls would show the correct details, but the loop never looped.
        </p>
        <p>
          Why did the loop not loop? It turned out that I had forgotten to declare the variable being used as the loop iterator. Once I compared my loop with one that worked, the difference became evident.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, I made the change and ran it again - all the loops ran and outputted all the variables to the console. I was then able to remove the console logging, document, and save my work.
        </p>
        <p>
          How did this make me feel? Pleased that I had found the solution without having spent too long on it, but also more wary of Javascript. This language takes no prisoners!
        </p>
        <p>
          It also taught me that even if your code doesn't throw an error, it doesn't mean your code works. Testing is vital!
        </p>
        <br />
        <h2>My Elegant Solution to a Problem</h2>
        <p>
          I was finding that I was writing a particular property object multiple times within the same function.
        </p>
        <p>
          It made the code look messy and complex, and it was complex enough that I could have made spelling mistakes easily.
        </p>
        <p>
          I had the idea that I could declare a variable and use that to shorten it substantially - to see if this was possible I scoped it out and did a test via the console.
        </p>
        <p>
          Everything looked good, so I declared it as a new variable. This worked really well and the code became more readable.
        </p>
        <p>
          Throughout this process it felt like a journey of discovery - going somewhere new and seeing if something was possible
        </p>
        <p>
          I learned that code spread over more lines with declared variables is easier to read then trying to cram all the code into the same line.
        </p>

            <td>Normally my first approach to a new problem is to put in what I think my solution could be, then see if it works. If it fails I can use the error code to point me in the right direction.</td>

            <td>Error Messages are something I'm still working on understanding - I love it when it gives me a line number to work on, but sometimes the way to get the best information from the error messages is to write them yourself.</td>
