      <h2>Foundations Reflection</h2>
      <p>The three things I have learned about my self and my ego are:</p>
      <li>
        <ol>I don't like to meditate - I love to get cracking into something straight away, and use my breaks to meditate and mull on issues while I have a walk around.</ol>
        <ol>I'm aware of my intelligence - I seek out challenges and people who are also intelligent and interested in the same things, and this is my ego.</ol>
        <ol>I value trust and integrity in close friends - I keep my friend circle small but I tend to hold onto friends for a very long time. I value people of integrity and intelligence extremely highly, both personally and professionally.</ol>
      </li>
      <br />
      <p>
        My values are intelligence (both IQ and EQ) and integrety - in terms of programming I would consider these two values to be some of the most important - the ability to understand people and the task at hand, and for people to trust in what you are doing.
      </p>
      <p>
        For learning, it's the ability to take a concept and put it into action, and to hopefully do it right the first time around so that reworks are less essential.
      </p>
      <p>
        Empathy (or EQ) is valuable to learning as it lets you figure out where other people are currently, as well as what your tutors are trying to focus on.
      </p>
      <p>
        In terms of programming, EQ is extremely valuable in teamwork and a lot of professional programming is doing tasks as part of a team project, so being great at communicating means better project work for everyone.
      </p>
      <p>
        Self-Awareness in learning - knowing where you are at and what your current state of mind is helps you to know when you need a break, and when is a good time to knuckle down and put in some extra time.
      </p>
      <p>
        In programming, self-awareness helps you understand your own skills and limitations and prompts you to know when to ask for help and the best way and time to offer help to others.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        The core learning has surprised me with the random bits that I didn't know that have come up over the Foundations weeks - I thought I knew a lot about core already, but I can see that even in modern times new ground is being broken all the time in how we understand 'core'.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's challenging trying to put some of it into practice - especially the pair challenges when you're working remotely. In person it's easy to grab someone and pair program or loop, but trying to schedule or run these things over discord/slack/zoom can be a real challenge.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        We spend so much time focusing on core because it's essential to professional programming. Unless you set yourself up as a company and program by yourself, you're going to be working with other people.
      </p>
      <p>
        After doing this course you'd be starting out as a Junior Programmer / Developer. As such, having humility and the ability to work with others is essential as you'll be mentored and working as the junior on programming tasks. It's really essential to understand code review, responsibilities, and teamwork which are all covered by core.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Time spent studying core here is not a waste of time - it really is a focus on teamwork, which is always important no matter what sort of programming that you do (backend, frontend, full stack, etc).
      </p>
      <p>
        As you get more experience, you'll be expected to mentor others. As a less experienced programmer you'll be expected to put your ego aside and follow orders and listen to your mentors. The main justification is safety - all of these things are there to protect you, as often you'll be working on code bases for customers.
      </p>
      <p>
        These customers will have expectations in code reliability and not following expectations and having poor core abilities will impact you professionally. You can be an amazing programmer, but core abilities will enhance your ability to deal with crisis and work your way through promotions and management.
