        <h2>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h2>
        <p>Tricky question - it's hard to see the path until you're walking the path.
          In the immediate future my goal is to use this Bootcamp to get me a role as a Junior Programmer / Developer with my employer, Fingermark.
          The future depends on how I use this career change from a Support role to become more experienced and learn new technologies.
          Based on my experience with a bit of luck and hard work, this could lead me to a Team Lead / Senior Developer / Management role.</p>
        <h2>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</h2>
        <p>I'm a fast learner - it doesn't take me too long to aquire and start using new concepts, and I'm also a skilled communicator.
          My weaknesses is that I like things to be right, and done my way. As such, I make sure that everything is roughly done and then go back and focus on the bits I feel still need to be completed, and I also take extra care on reading the questions in case my interpretation is incorrect.</p>
