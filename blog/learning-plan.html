        <h2>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h2>
        <p>
          Tricky question - it's hard to see the path until you're walking the
          path. In the immediate future my goal is to use this Bootcamp to get
          me a role as a Junior Programmer / Developer with my employer,
          Fingermark. The future depends on how I use this career change from a
          Support role to become more experienced and learn new technologies.
          Based on my experience with a bit of luck and hard work, this could
          lead me to a Team Lead / Senior Developer / Management role.
        </p>
        <h2>
          A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to
          learning
        </h2>
        <p>
          I'm a fast learner - it doesn't take me too long to aquire and start
          using new concepts, and I'm also a skilled communicator. My weaknesses
          is that I like things to be right, and done my way. As such, I make
          sure that everything is roughly done and then go back and focus on the
          bits I feel still need to be completed, and I also take extra care on
          reading the questions in case my interpretation is incorrect.
        </p>
        <h2>
          What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see
          developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
        </h2>
        <p>
          I would like to work on my team skills - working as a team, developing
          together, mentor/learning roles. In real life, developers normally
          work as teams that split out their bits of work and then pull it all
          together at the end of each sprint - as such, improving teamwork and
          soft skills is essential for any developer.
        </p>
        <h2>
          A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.
        </h2>
        <p>
          I have already made sure that over the next few months when this
          course runs, I will not have distractions or commitments that detract
          from my learning. I am also aware that I have a wealth of real-world
          experience in the IT industry - however, this means I need to be
          careful of how much I share and always put my learning as the top
          priority. It also means I may have learned some bad habits that need
          to be "unlearned" in order for me to be the best developer and person
          I can be. Working productively and safely with others - I will focus
          on integrity and productivity, making sure that I am fair and focused.
          If things build up I will be seeking assistance with facilitators and
          cutting out any distractions and non-essential things, as well as
          managing my time and my breaks to bring things back to a steady level.
          I will make sure that my time with industry/community representatives
          is saved/delayed until the Careers week(s), so that we are working on
          this together after the course content is covered.
        </p>
        <h2>
          A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way
        </h2>
        <p>
          I have already struck this with this week (Sprint 2)'s work - there
          have been some blockers that I needed to reach out for help with. As
          such, I am now more comfortable with how long I should work on a
          problem and researching various results on the internet and
          experimenting before I reach out for help from the facilitators. As a
          rule of thumb, I have figured out that the optimum time to reach out
          is either half an hour or whenever trying to fix the issue is no
          longer "fun" - whichever comes first.
        </p>
        <h2>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h2>
        <p>
          I want to be told if I'm heading off the path, or if my expectations
          or directions are starting to go in the wrong direction. I value
          honesty above all else, and this is critical to my learning journey.
          In other words, be brutally honest with me and let's head off any
          potential issues before they become problems.
        </p>
        <h2>
          Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are
          committed to other things.
        </h2>
        <p>
          There's a power cut scheduled for my house on 08/02/2023 0900-1500. It
          may be shorter, but at this time I'll either bring my laptop into town
          to study in a cafe, or work more in the evening and the other days to
          make up for this outage. There is a Homegroup meeting scheduled for
          1300 hrs that day so I'll attend using mobile data and tether my
          laptop to my phone.
