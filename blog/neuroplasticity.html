        <h2>Neuroplasticity</h2>
        <p>
          Neuroplasticitys main foundation is that IQ is not a fixed variable, and can be trained and increased by absolutely anyone.
It also dives into the concept that putting more effort into learning and practice can not only teach you a subject, but also make you smarter by exercising your neural pathways in the brain.
        </p>
        <p>
          Part of the study goes into how practicing a task mentally can give you almost the exact same benefit as if you do it for real - even physical exercise. As a result, it opens you up to improving on things even if you can't physically do them where you are. As a result, time spent on a bus or a plane where you are a passenger can be used for mental practice.
        </p>
        <p>
          Anything that engages your brain is technically an exercise in improving neuroplasticity. Video and Board Games? Check. Learn a language? Check. Travel and Exercise? Check and Check. Talk to friends? Check.
As a result, the best way to increase neuroplasticity is to look at your daily routine and build in tasks and events that help you build cognitive abilities. I have a board game group I go to once a week for example, and it's fairly large and social. Learning new games and engaging with new people helps to build my neuroplasticity.

        <p>
          This resource focused a lot on health benefits, especially around reducing the effects of illness and aging by using mental exercises. One of the resources linked to a study they did on London taxidrivers after they had to study the streets in London for their driver exams.

          This listed different ways to improve Neuroplasticity, including games and social interactions.

        <h2>Growth Mindset</h2>
        <p>
          Having a Growth Mindset means knowing that with practice we will get better at something, especially if we attempt difficult or challenging tasks.
          Growth Mindset is about believing in yourself and knowing that your current abilities do not define you - that putting effort into new things will help us to improve. It links to Neuroplasticity in that having the right mindset and constant practice of challenging tasks can improve our intelligence and skills.
        </p>
        <p>
          I've heard of these concepts before, however the studies where they put this into place around schools and learning environments make perfect sense - having the right attitude while learning makes a huge difference into the effort you put in and the rewards you get out.
        </p>
        <p>
          Growth Mindset is a frame of mind - the best way to integrate it with my learning journey is to practice it with the meditation segment of each day - being positive and open to new experiences, and attempting tasks even when they are outside my skillset knowing that practice makes anything achievable.

          This is about comparing Growth Mindset with a Fixed Mindset, by highlighting the differences it shows you what to avoid and what to strive for.

        <p>
          This is about working on a Growth Mindset at any age of your life, and self-advocacy.

        <h2>Learning Plan Adjustments</h2>
        <p>
          Looking at how to integrate Neuroplasticity and a Growth Mindset with my personal Learning Plan:
          <strong>Career Pathway - </strong>that I need to continue using these tools after graduation from Dev Academy as it will assist in facing professional challenges further down the track, especially around self-motivation and looking at any setbacks as opportunities for improvement.
          <strong>Strengths and Limitations - </strong>to take on challenges and to see weaknesses and obstacles as something that can be changed into something positive with practice and understanding.
          <strong>Human Skills to develop at Dev Academy - </strong>In a way, Dev Academy is a good place to work on and develop these skills, I covered teamwork in my personal goals and this is definitely something that can be cultivated with the correct mindset.
          <strong>Workload management / Seeking help - </strong>knowing that assistance comes in many forms. That developing a Growth Mindset is about trying new things and not being afraid to ask for help or feedback on my work.
