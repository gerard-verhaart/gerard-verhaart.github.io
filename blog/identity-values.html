      <h2>Stories</h2>
      <p>
        I documented a well-used and complex process for an overseas vendor of our software who was completely out of
        our timezone. Common issues were only being resolved overnight and causing some friction between them and the
        people they were supporting.
        The process involved trust (figuring out what they need and trusting them with the right access), critical
        thinking (completely putting yourself in their shoes to make sure there were no documentation gaps), using
        feedback (creating a guide with fixes to the problems they normally encountered) and handover (training their
        team on how to use the documentation)
      </p>
      <h2>Testimonial</h2>
      <p>
        The testimonials I got from the above story mainly came from other support staff, who noticed a marked drop in
        tickets lodged with our helpdesk (roughly 90%+ drop)
      </p>
      <h2>Achievements</h2>
      <p>
        Including the achievement above, I keep a folder in my inbox for compliments that people give you at work for
        the work you do. Most of the time people will appreciate what you do but you need to value the times when they
        put that feedback in writing. Also, I consider personal achievements as well - education gained, family
        milestones, personal achievements (Drivers Licence, etc)
      </p>
      <h2>Where do my values come from?</h2>
      <p>
        My values come from my upbringing, my family, my teachers, and myself.
      </p>
      <h2>Proverb</h2>
      <p>
        "Non mihi, non tibi, sed nobis" - It's not for you, it's not for me, it's for everyone. To strive for the
        betterment of society.
      </p>
      <h2>Review</h2>
      <p>
        My review of learning has been that so far the course is going well - there are things I have learned, some
        things I have reinforced, and I can see real value in dedicating my time and resources towards this course.
      </p>
      <h2>My personality type</h2>
      <p>
        According to online resources it is ENTP-A (Myers-Briggs - The Debater)
        I can't speak for the reliablility of online quizzes, however it is true that I like to consider all angles of
        an issue or argument and this is part of my problem-solving process and how I interact with others.

      <h2>Blog</h2>
      <p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Ethical dilemma: </strong><br />One good example I remember is that a change had been made by a peer
          that I spotted on a production environment, which caused a sync process to stop running (without the client
          being notified). I raised it with the person who made the change, and was dissatisfied with the response so
          took it to my manager - at that time, the requirements to fix the issue were complex (the change in question
          was an essential bug fix) and so the issue was disregarded. A few months down the track the client noticed and
          raised a priority incident, and I was able to provide my manager with the full details of what had happened
          and that they had signed off on it. The outcome of this was that my recommendations were taken into
          consideration and eventually a Change Manager was employed.</li>
        <li><strong>Culture and influences: </strong><br />I have a blended family - my parents are of Maori and Dutch
          descent, and my wife is Japanese - we are very multi-cultural and diverse within our family and friends.</li>
        <li><strong>Strengths and learning support: </strong><br />I have a lot of experience in IT, problem solving
          processes, and I have always studied throughout my career. I'm not afraid to take measured risks and take on
          responsibility, and have been a Project Lead on several occasions. I'm also very strong with documentation and
          setting up transparent processes for tracking progress on large projects.</li>
        <li><strong>Learning and career limitation evaluation: </strong><br />My biggest career limitation is that I can
          work very quickly but make a lot of errors when I do so. As a result, I regularly need to assess myself on my
          work speed and make sure I don't rush my work, as well as set reasonable expectations and deadlines for the
          work that I take on, and keep people updated with my progress.</li>
        <li><strong>Example with working with others, resistance / tension: </strong><br />At one time I was required to
          set up a new (replacement) computer for the company Office Manager (2IC of the company). She was already
          unhappy with the failure of her existing computer and required everything on her new computer to be exactly
          the same as the old one, including software and bookmarks.
          The pressure was high with this one due to her exacting standards and forward personality, however by working
          with the CEO of the company (for distraction) I was able to swap out her computer with minimal downtime and
          fuss.</li>
