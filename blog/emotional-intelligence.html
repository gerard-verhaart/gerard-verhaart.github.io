      <h2>What is it?</h2>
      <p>
        EQ stands for Emotional Quotient - to me it stands for your emotional and interpersonal skills.
The official definition is that EQ is the ability to understand, use, and manage your own emotions in positive ways to relieve stress, communicate effectively, empathize with others, overcome challenges and defuse conflict.
      </p>
      <h2>How is EQ different to IQ?</h2>
      <p>
        For my own interpretation, EQ covers all skills and personality traits we cultivate as people that isn't covered by IQ (Intelligence Quotient). A lot of it is life skills and a high EQ means someone that knows themselves, how to manage their flaws and enhance their strengths, and has trained themselves in the social skills needed to function highly in society.
      </p>
      <h2>Why is EQ important?</h2>
      <p>
        To me, IQ is the ability to function on a task by yourself without assistance or helping others. EQ is the ability to work within society or a team, or even one-to-one.
EQ is far more valuable to teamwork, and in most cases employers will value it over a high IQ as their focus is on being able to manage teams and projects, instead of individuals. If a team has a high collective EQ it means they will be able to cover for IQ gaps by working together to resolve "blockers" and prevent developers from getting stuck on tasks that will affect the delivery of an overall project.
